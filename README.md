# F–α–ε–P Framework Blueprint

A reusable Jupyter/Colab notebook for evaluating models, experiments, or processes under heavy tails, sequential updates, and uncertainty. Includes explanations, code, calculations, and visualizations.

## Features
- **F (Concretion):** Empirical distribution and measurable outcomes
- **α (Ingression):** Tail index estimation via Hill-type estimators
- **ε (Involution):** Quantile-based truncation and sequential update coherence
- **P (Projection):** Aggregation using quadratic, harmonic, and geometric quasinorm lenses
- **Visualizations:** Distribution, lens scores, streaming updates, and 3D evaluation cube

## Usage
1. Run the notebook cells top-to-bottom.
2. Simulate data or load your own CSV (see instructions in the notebook).
3. Adjust tolerance (ε) and lens weights (α₂, α₋₁, α₀) as needed.
4. Read inline commentary for scientific context and transferability.

## Reproducibility
- All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
- The notebook is self-contained and ready for Colab or Jupyter.
